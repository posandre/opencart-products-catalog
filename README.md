# opencart-products-catalog
This repository contains a modification for OpenCart 2.0 that enables the management of product catalogs within the admin panel. It introduces a new "Catalogs" tab in the product form, supports multiple languages (English, Russian, Ukrainian), and displays catalog details including file, name, sort order, and date added.
